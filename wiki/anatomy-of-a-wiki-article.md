Previous editors have flagged this article as one that needs improvement. Here's a chance for us to help make Wikipedia better!

## Click "edit" to begin editing

After you click "edit", you'll see the article content in wikitext. In the graphic below, the orange boxes separate the wikitext for the "Multiple issues" warning, the "Infobox" that appears on the published article's right side, and the beginning of the article text. Note the tripled single-quotes around Fay's name to format it as bold and the doubled equal signs around "Legacy" to format it as a level-2 heading.
