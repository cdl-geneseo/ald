# Editing Basis

Wikipedia uses a simple markup language called “Wikitext” to format content. You can practice using this markkup language in your user sandbox.

The Wikipedia editing interface also provides some visual editing tools, but taking the time to learn the basics of wikitext will make editing easier for you in the long run.

Wikipedia has a [very useful cheatsheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet) that shows you how to do things like format text as bold or italic, link to another Wikipedia page, and link to a website outside Wikipedia.
